Instalation instructions:

The build system is meson (if you do not already have meson
and ninja installed, do that first).

This repository builds mcpdisp. Dependencies are JACK Audio Connection Kit and FLTK.
For many Linux distros this means installing libfltk1.3-dev and libjack-jackd2-dev
(or the jackd1 equivalent if using jackd1)

meson build --prefix=/usr
cd build && ninja
sudo ninja install

If installed as above, mcpdisp can be removed from the system with:

sudo ninja uninstall
