Instalation instructions:

There is no ./configure script as this is a simple program with few
dependencies. If your system is set up to build things at all you have
everything needed with the exception of libjack. There is probably a package
called libjack-dev (if you are using jackd1) or libjack-jackd2-dev (if you
are using jackd2 or jackdbus) in your distro you will need.

Scratch that, fltk1.3 or higher is needed too. So on a debian based (Ubuntu)
system install libfltk1.3-dev and that will grab what you need.

So:

make

make install (as root with su or sudo)
