Instalation instructions:

There is no ./configure script as this is a simple program with few
dependencies. If your system is set up to build things at all you have
everything needed with the exception of libjack. There is probably a package
called libjack-dev (if you are using jackd1) or libjack-jackd2-dev (if you
are using jackd2 or jackdbus) in your distro you will need.

So:

make

At this point you may wish to try ./mcpdisp.sh to see if you like where it
starts. The default is -0-0 or the lower right corner. I like +2000-1 which
puts the display about 1/3 of the way from the left of my right screen, but
this is not good if you have only one screen. Feel free to edit mcpdisp.sh
before you do:

make install (as root with su or sudo)
